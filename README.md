## Details

> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their promising performance in comprehending natural languages and adpating to multiple downstream tasks. Despite their robust generalized abilities, the use of LLMs in certain domains, notably in the medical and clinical fields, is limited due to the potential for inaccurate responses and incorrect knowledge extraction. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has had a global impact, causing millions of deaths and significantly affecting the world economy. As a response, scientists have carried out extensive basic and clinical research to understand the virological characteristics, mutational landscapes, and clinical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 to aid in its diagnosis and treatment. This has resulted in thousands of scientific papers and the establishment of disease-specific regulatory mechanisms, presenting an opportunity for LLMs to fine-tune with these SARS-CoV-2 related datasets for reliable knowledge queries and responses. In this study, we combined the in-house SARS-COV-2 disease knowledge datasets from our collaborator at Guangzhou Labortory with our new LLM framework (XXX), to construct a SARS-COV-2 disease-specific LLM model (XXX). Our disease-specific LLM outperforms other existing LLMs of similar size of parameters in disease-related question answering and SARS-COV-2 related knowledge extraction, demonstrating the potential of applying LLMs in various specific domains.

#### SARS-COV-2 Question Answering

---

**Q1: What is Markdown?**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

---

---

**Q2: Where can I use Markdown?**

Markdown can be used in many places. From note taking apps, websites like GitHub or Reddit, to Data Science tools like Jupyter Notebook.

---

**Q3: How can I create a heading in Markdown?**

You can create a heading in Markdown by using the `#` symbol followed by a space and then your heading text. The number of `#` symbols determines the level of the heading. For example, `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, `### Heading 3`.
